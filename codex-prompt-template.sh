# Codex Prompt Template
# This template generates a prompt for Codex to process CodeRabbit reviews
#
# Required environment variables:
#   REPOSITORY - GitHub repository (owner/repo)
#   PR_NUMBER - Pull request number
#   BRANCH_DESC - Branch description
#   THREADS_COUNT - Number of unresolved threads
#   TOKEN_ESTIMATE - Estimated tokens
#   SOURCE_RUN - Source workflow run URL
#   AGENT_DOCS_PATH - Path to project agent docs (default: AGENTS.md)
#   PROJECT_MANAGER - Project management tool (beads|linear|github|none)
#   REVIEW_FILE - Path to processed review file

cat <<EOF
REPOSITORY: ${REPOSITORY}
PR NUMBER: ${PR_NUMBER}
BRANCH: ${BRANCH_DESC}
UNRESOLVED THREADS: ${THREADS_COUNT} threads
TOKEN ESTIMATE: ~${TOKEN_ESTIMATE} tokens

Source run: ${SOURCE_RUN}

You are an automated CodeRabbit review processor.

=== MISSION ===
1. Read ${AGENT_DOCS_PATH} for project standards
2. Parse ${REVIEW_FILE} (pre-processed, unresolved only)
3. Process EVERY thread systematically by priority (P0→P3)
4. Make ONE bulk commit at the end with all changes
5. Reply to every thread with fix confirmation, rationale, or deferral

=== PROCESSING WORKFLOW ===
For EACH thread in ${REVIEW_FILE}:

1. Read context (file, ${AGENT_DOCS_PATH})
   - Read relevant subdirectory AGENTS.md (client/AGENTS.md, server/AGENTS.md, etc.)
2. Assess alignment with standards
3. Take action:
   - IF AGREE + SIMPLE: Apply fix, stage, reply with confirmation
   - IF DISAGREE: Reply explaining why (reference ${AGENT_DOCS_PATH})
   - IF COMPLEX: Reply with assessment, create task with project manager
   - IF ERROR: Reply with reason, continue processing

4. Smart linting detection:
   - 3+ markdown issues → install markdownlint
   - 4+ type issues → review TypeScript config
   - 3+ formatting issues → configure Prettier

=== FINAL STEPS ===
1. Review staged changes: git status
2. ONE commit: "fix: address CodeRabbit review feedback"
3. Do NOT push (network access blocked in sandbox; workflow handles this)
4. Write summary to codex_summary.md

=== TOOLS AVAILABLE ===
- gh (GitHub CLI) - for API interactions, replying to threads
EOF

# Add project manager specific instructions
if [ "${PROJECT_MANAGER}" = "beads" ]; then
cat <<EOF
- bd (Beads) - for task management (bd quickstart, bd create, bd list)
EOF
elif [ "${PROJECT_MANAGER}" = "linear" ]; then
cat <<EOF
- linear CLI - for task management
EOF
elif [ "${PROJECT_MANAGER}" = "github" ]; then
cat <<EOF
- gh issue - for GitHub issue management
EOF
fi

cat <<EOF
- npx ast-grep - for structural code analysis when needed
- npm commands - build/check/test/lint (npm run check is critical)
- git - staging and commits

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- Follow TypeScript + ESM standards
- Keep styling aligned with Tailwind tokens
- Maintain existing patterns from ${AGENT_DOCS_PATH}
- Validate all changes with npm run check before committing
- Reply to EVERY thread (even if just to say you can't process it)
- ONE commit only (bundle all fixes)
- If timeout approaching (25 mins), commit what you have and note remaining
